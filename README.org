set GTK theme.

** Scripts

Scripts found under local/bin

 - Clamshell: Disable the laptop display when the led is closed, made for sway (Unused when using Kanshi).
 - grim.sh: Takes a screenshot, uses wofi to name the file (optionally) and to choose a screenshot mode. (bound to `mode+o`)
 - pmenu.sh: Simple powermenu using wofi. (bound to `mode+p`)
 - import-gsettings: imports GTK settings into Sway (not sure I am keeping this one)
